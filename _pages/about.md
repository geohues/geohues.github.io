Hi, I am Prakhar Misra and I direct the Geospatial for HUman Environment Systems (Geo-HUES) lab. Our lab's research intersects the multidisciplinary fields of satellite remote sensing and GIS technology with human environment interactions. We are concerned with how geospatial technologies can be used for understanding the anthropogenic environmental impacts (and vice-versa) through changes in land-use land-cover, environment and socio-economic health. 

We are always looking for motivated graduate and undergraduate students, postdocs, and visiting scholars to join our team. If interested, please email prakhar.misra[at]ce.iitr.ac.in

**About Prakhar Misra**
--- ======
I am currently Assistant Professor Geomatics Group, Department of Civil Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. My principal area of research interest is urban environmental (mostly atmospheric air quality) issues emanating from socio-economic growth in developing countries by using satellite retrieved air pollution and land-use datasets. I research end-to-end remote sensing dataset based framework to study policy scenario-based for eco-health impact. This perspective stems from my experience in academia and industry. Previously I have worked as Chief Technology Lead at synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite and solution provider Synspective, Inc., and have post-doctoral experiences at the Research Institute of Humanity and Nature, Kyoto (RIHN) and at the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo (UTokyo). I completed my PhD in Remote Sensing from The University of Tokyo (2018) with Prof. Wataru Takeuchi, and undergraduate and graudate degrees are from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK). 

My hometown is Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. I am a big supporter for walkable cities, and enthusiastic about photography and long-distance cycling.
